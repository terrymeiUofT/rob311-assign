# General 

Do not import any libraries into the code.  All neccessary libraries have already been included in the template files. Do not modify the form of the import statements either (e.g., by importing individual functions from numpy: just access them through np.function_name()). 

# Testing your code

The template files include sample tests. Be sure to explore the data and make your own!

# Submitting your code 

When you are ready to submit, archive the files with the following command:

tar cvf handin.tar breadth_first_search.py bidirectional_search.py a_star_search.py

Then upload handin.tar to http://courses.jonathankelly.info/courses/ROB311H1/assessments/searchalgorithms/
